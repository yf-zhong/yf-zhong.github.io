Hi there! My name is Yifan Zhong. I’m currently a second-year master’s student in *Computer Science* at [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/), having previously obtained my Bachelor’s degree in *Electrical Engineering and Computer Science* from [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).

I’m particularly interested in backend and full-stack development. Last summer, I completed an internship as a Backend Engineer at **Shepherd Money**, a startup focusing on open banking and personal financial management applications. Prior to this, during my software engineer internship at **Microsoft**, I also contributed to the creation of a decentralized financial system for supply chain management.

I am passionate about developing scalable and robust systems and look forward to collaborating with like-minded professionals to contribute to impactful projects.
